# OpenAI-Cartpole
Building a model to balance OpenAI Cartpole

In this Notebook, I have build a RL model using the framework stable-baseline which is a set of improved implementations of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms based on OpenAI Baselines.

Tasks I done in the Notebook:

* I have build the Model using PPO Algorithm and also saved the tensorboard log which we can visualise it in local host.

* I have applied callback which stops the training with certain reward threshold.

* I have applied different neural network policy to the model.

* I used different algorithm beside PPO to train the model.
